## Search Terms

My goal was to be able to have my nav menu items link to another page of my website. I constantly got error messages saying 404 Not found, so I used the search term [How to make multiple pages with svelte], this turned out to be a terrible search term as all the top links were vague and did not give me a solution to my problems. I refined my search with the key term ["Svelte Routing"], and ["Multiple routes Svelte"]. These search terms took me to the correct links of [https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/params], and [https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/routing]. By reading the docs rigorously I was finally able to make my Contact, About, and Gallery section in my nav route to the appropriate locations.
